											<h4>My name is Mrs. Joan R. Muoti, I am the principal State House Girls’ High school, since 2008.  In the last five years I have had the privilege to work with very diligent, committed teachers, spread out through different departments.  <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more" style='display: none'>The school is also supported by a non-teaching staff headed by the bursar and includes the school nurse, matrons, librarian, cooks, and ground people among others.

•	Moved the school mean from a B- to a B of 8.5, the highest ever achieved in the school,
•	Expansion of classes
•	Improvement on ICT
Improvement in school discipline and general environment.  We are undertaking expansion in the hostel, dining hall and more classrooms to meet the growing population demand.  We are also looking into building more staff houses .

We also nurture student’s talents and hobbies to make the students wholesome to this and we have participated in International competitive musical concerts in Canada and Turkmenistan and a basketball tournament in United States among others.

											<h3>From the Deputy Principal Administration</h3>
											<h4>The first mandate of the Deputy Principal’s office is maintaining high standards of discipline among students thus facilitate achievement of set educational goals.

The responsibility is undertaken by generally all stake holders but more specifically by the Deputy Principal <span id="dot">...</span><span id="mor" style='display: none'>Administration, members of the discipline committee, class and House teachers subject teachers and school matrons. 
The deputy constantly communicates behavioral expectations to students at assembly and develops appropriate intervention measures in order to curb indiscipline among students.

Deputy Principal Administration is expected to update the Parents Association on the discipline in the school.

The office keeps record related to discipline.  This information acts as reference when giving letters of recommendations and leaving certificates.  The discipline committee has authority to punish errant students.

The office develops and amends disciplinary policies and guidelines.  The department also harnesses staff members’ synergy in promoting high level disciplinary standards.  They administer different and corrective measures on errant students in collaboration with other teachers in school.

The Deputy’s office inducts Form one students on the school’s disciplinary expectations.  Proactively responds to the disciplinary challenges posed by students’ dynamics in the school and develops appropriate interventions for disciplinary challenges.  It also empowers the students’ council with regard to management of discipline.
The department also positively influences how teachers specifically teachers on duty respond to discipline issues.

The effective discipline department sustains a stable educational environment free of disciplinary disruptions and distractions. The office proactively prevents disciplinary disruptions and distractions.

The office handles major discipline cases by investigation and recommendation of disciplinary action to be taken.  It upholds general discipline of staff and students in the schools.  It also looks into any chronic academic discipline with a an aim of assisting teachers enhance learning.


Consults with parents in reference to chronic discipline cases.  Support subject teachers in dealing with student academic indiscipline in their respective subjects.

Work closely on daily basis with the Deputy Principal Academics in ensuring that both social and academic indiscipline amongst students is addressed.

The two offices, ie Deputy Principal Administration and Deputy Principal Academics work closely with QUASO Department to enhance quality teaching and better time management of school.

We believe that discipline is directly linked to academic performance.   It is therefore imperative that high standards of discipline are maintained.  Enhance strict time management and adherence to the daily routine.

The school has also established a student council to replace the outdated prefect system.  The Deputy Administration office coordinates the election by secret ballot and winners are then announced and trained in their different capacities.  The student council is a very effective tool of upholding discipline.  

The immense support of the Board of managers (BOM) principal, (PA)Parents and all departments has gone a long way in improving discipline the school has realized lately. 

I trust that with God on our side we will get where we are meant to be academically and in discipline.  God bless you.</span>

						<h2>School History</h2>
					</div>
						<p>The site on which State House Girls’ High school stands was once a European hospital. The building of the hospital consisted of the present main administration block. The sisters’ mess was the present teacher’s houses, which are adjacent to the main gate to State House.

To make room for a school in January 1954 the hospital was moved to become the present day Nairobi hospital. The school was then started and was called the New Girls’ Secondary School. What was left of the hospital acted as a European Dispensary and for some time the school and the dispensary existed side by side.<span id="do">...</span><span id="mo" style='display: none'>

At the end of 1955 the school was split into two, New Girls’ Secondary School and Highland school in Eldoret (now called Moi Girls’ School). The whole student body together with the headmistress and some equipment moved to Eldoret.

From 1956, the new student body consisting of boys’ and girls’ was started. The school was renamed to Delamere High School – Delamere was one of most striking European Settlers in Kenya. The school continued catering for boys’ and girls’ education for about two years when in 1958, the boys moved to a new school which was called Delamere Boys’ School (now called Upper Hill High School).

For about 10 years the school was known as Delamere Girls’ School. In 1967, it assumed the name State House Road Girls’ High School which later changed to the present name State House Girls High School omitting the word “Road”.

Earlier on, in 1961 the school’s administration had come under a Board of Governors. In 1973, the school was taken over by the Kenyan Government thus becoming a fully maintained government school.

From its foundation up to the early sixties the school remained exclusively for European girls. With the approaching independence the school opened its doors to other races both in the student composition and the teaching staff.

The first two Asian Girls were admitted in form one in 1962. These were ParvizShirinManji (1/1/1962) and GwaderiShamshad (15/1/1962). Unfortunately, Parviz died one year later in late September 1963 at H.H.Aga Khan Platinum Jubilee Hospital medical ward bed number:14 from heart hemorrhage while Gwaderi cleared her O – level and went to England.

The first African girls were admitted in 1964. These were Jessica Ngoya(Jan 1964) whose father Mr. H.W. Ngoya was Webuye division educational officer and Wamaitha Margaret Philomena (September 1964). Jessica went on to become the school’s first African prefect (1965) and eventually the first African head girl of the school in June 1966. Jessica Ngoya went on to become a lecturer at the University of Addis Ababa.

The first Chinese girl was admitted in 2011. TianAoZhong (22/2/2011) is from Boye Middle School, Boye County, Boarding city, Hebei province in China.

The first Asian teacher came in 1966 and shortly but progressively more and more Asian and African girls joined as more Europeans left Kenya after independence.

The school has and is still open to all races in Kenya and nationalities.

Apart from human development there has been a spectacular development in physical amenities. The school has expanded, adapted and improved.

In 1983-84 through the sponsorship of His Excellency the former and 2nd President of Kenya His Excellency Hon. Daniel ToroitichArapMoi and his spirit of Harambee the first boarding block was built where in 1985 the first 360 borders moved in. A new boarding block was added in 2004 to mark the Golden Jubilee of the school.
